# SWM.01 – Spherical Word Methodology: Core Framework
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
Defines the foundational principles and epistemic logic of SWM as a semantic physics substrate. SWM enables translation and conceptual drift through non-symbolic rotation across multiple epistemic axes.

## Core Concepts
- **Geoid**: A semantic sphere representing a concept in multidimensional tension space.
- **Axis**: An interpretive modality (e.g., logic, metaphor, code) through which meaning is rotated.
- **Layer**: Contextual depth zones (Literal to Mythic) across which pressure propagates.
- **Semantic Rotation**: The act of translating a contradiction through different epistemic axes.
- **Translation Loop**: Decontextualize → Resonate → Recontextualize, without relying on human-centric meaning.

## Architecture
SWM forms the semantic substrate on which Kimera operates:
- Enables pressure-based transformation of knowledge
- Provides layer and axis topology for contradiction injection
- Supports polyglot, multi-modal, non-symbolic reasoning

## Parameters
- Axis Affinity Vectors
- Layer Stack Properties
- Rotation Friction Coefficients
- Pressure Signature Maps

## Algorithms / Functions
- `generate_geoid()`
- `rotate_axis(geoid, axis)`
- `calculate_resonance()`
- `match_recontextualization(surface_requirements)`

## Interactions
- Drives Kimera’s pressure engine and contradiction processing
- Forms the semantic field for scar accumulation and echo drift
- Interface layer for all external input (text, data, signal)

## Examples
- Rotating “death” through logic = binary end state
- Rotating “death” through ritual = transition rite
- Rotating “death” through myth = sacred loop

## Open Questions
- Can axes evolve with experience?
- Do certain layer configurations create semantic paradox attractors?
- Can non-language data (EEG, code, vibration) form geoids?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Core framework documented, tied directly to Kimera engine semantics
