# KMR.08 – Translator Interface Layer
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To define the optional interface module responsible for rendering Kimera’s semantic deformations into human-readable or system-actionable formats. This is the boundary layer between Kimera’s non-symbolic cognition and external symbolic worlds.

## Core Concepts
- **Translation Surface**: A target modality (text, sound, code, image, gesture) for interpretation.
- **Resonance Mapping**: Identifying pressure signatures that correspond to known output motifs.
- **Transduction Interface**: An interpreter capable of converting pressure into output form.
- **Context Binder**: A structure that reattaches output to external framing (language, discourse, medium).

## Architecture
- Receives post-rotation geoids with scars, echoes, and collapse patterns.
- Matches field deformation to a pre-configured output archetype or signature.
- Output may be symbolic (language), reactive (motion), or structural (data schema).
- Can be plural: multiple translators may coexist depending on output need.

## Parameters
- TranslationMode: (poetic, technical, minimal, abstract)
- SurfaceForm: target format (text, gesture, sound, code)
- PressureThreshold: minimum resonance needed to trigger translation
- ModalityBinder: function used to wrap output into coherent container

## Algorithms / Functions
- `render_output(geoid_signature, mode)`
- `map_pressure_to_surface(surface_form)`
- `bind_context(output, frame_rules)`
- `translate_echo_rings(semantic_region)`

## Interactions
- Receives semantic field output from Kimera’s rotation and collapse cycles
- Optional: can be disabled if Kimera is used as a backend semantic substrate
- Works with Axis Affinity and Scar Systems to find appropriate translation seeds

## Examples
- Semantic field scarred in L3 → translated into metaphor using poetic translator
- Collapse in L1 + L2 → renders a structural contradiction map for diagnostics
- Rotated contradiction through “gesture” axis → outputs a kinetic movement signature

## Open Questions
- Can translators evolve contextually based on past usage?
- Should different output layers maintain traceability to original contradiction?
- What does translation failure look like in this system?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Translator layer defined with modality and binding protocols
