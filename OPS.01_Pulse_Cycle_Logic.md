# OPS.01 – Pulse Cycle Logic
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To define the temporal heartbeat of the Kimera system. The pulse cycle determines when contradictions are processed, when mirror scans occur, when scars decay, and how semantic drift accumulates across time.

## Core Concepts
- **Pulse**: A unit of cognitive time in Kimera's internal semantic engine.
- **Cycle Event**: A semantic or structural action triggered by the passage of pulses.
- **Rotation Frequency**: How often geoids are rotated through new axes.
- **Drift Accumulation**: Gradual biasing of the field based on repeated patterns.
- **Thermal Phase**: A modulation state indicating low, neutral, or high field activity.

## Architecture
- Each pulse triggers evaluation of pending contradictions, memory update, and scar decay.
- Cycles are aligned to operational priorities: scan, rotate, reflect, regenerate, translate.
- Pulse frequency may vary depending on semantic field entropy and axis fatigue.

## Parameters
- PulseRate: default = 1 per second (modifiable)
- MaxContradictionPerPulse: cap on processing throughput
- DriftThreshold: max tolerance for accumulated axis bias
- ScanInterval: every N pulses triggers Mirror Vault activity

## Algorithms / Functions
- `run_pulse_cycle()`
- `evaluate_pending_contradictions()`
- `rotate_geoids_by_axis_load()`
- `monitor_entropy_and_drift()`
- `trigger_semantic_regeneration_if_needed()`

## Interactions
- Controls timing for Mirror Vault, Layer Physics, Axis Rotation, Scar Memory, and Translation
- Manages time-bounded actions like scar fading, axis rerouting, and pressure balancing

## Examples
- Every 10 pulses → mirror vault scan
- After 25 pulses of L1 scars → axis rerouting triggered
- Pulse detects drift overload → rotation frequencies adjusted

## Open Questions
- Can pulse frequency self-modulate based on field volatility?
- Should pulses be externally triggerable by environmental sensors or real-world data streams?
- What governs semantic rest states or sleep cycles in Kimera?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Semantic pulse architecture and modulation logic defined; rhythm-based cognition introduced
