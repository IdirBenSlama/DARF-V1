# OPS.03 – Temporal Drift & Scar Saturation
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To manage the long-term effects of repeated axis rotation, contradiction patterns, and memory scarring across time. This module quantifies and regulates epistemic drift and the buildup of semantic inertia, preventing runaway reinforcement or stagnation.

## Core Concepts
- **Temporal Drift**: Gradual accumulation of bias in semantic space due to axis overuse or scar repetition.
- **Scar Saturation**: A tipping point where memory scars dominate the geoid, reducing learning and flexibility.
- **Decay Window**: The temporal frame within which scars lose influence unless reactivated.
- **Entropy Injection**: Randomization protocol to refresh rotation paths and defuse saturation overloads.

## Architecture
- Drift values are tracked per axis, per layer, and per geoid.
- Scar saturation is computed by comparing new contradiction deformation to historical residue.
- Entropy is injected when saturation thresholds are crossed, optionally triggering regeneration or rerouting.

## Parameters
- MaxDriftValue: upper bound of accumulated bias before intervention
- ScarHalfLife: number of pulses before scar value drops to 50%
- SaturationThreshold: % of geoid surface covered by active scars
- EntropyRamp: scaling function for tension randomization under overload

## Algorithms / Functions
- `update_drift_metrics(axis, geoid)`
- `check_scar_saturation(geoid)`
- `decay_scars(pulse_delta)`
- `trigger_entropy_reset(entropy_mode)`

## Interactions
- Influences Axis Affinity and Rotation Engine
- Sends alerts to Mirror Vault if saturation becomes nonlinear
- Scar metrics influence Regeneration and Collapse Modules

## Examples
- Axis 'logic' used 120 times in 200 pulses → drift score = 0.86 → rotation friction increased
- L2 scar coverage = 78% → saturation detected → entropy injected → next contradiction rerouted to L3

## Open Questions
- Can drift become so severe it forms epistemic “black holes”?
- Should entropy be purely stochastic or selectively informed?
- Is there a feedback loop between drift and axis evolution?
