# FWD.01 – Semantic Entanglement Models
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To explore how semantic entities (geoids, axes, scars, and layers) can form non-linear, bidirectional, or persistent entanglements across Kimera’s field—mirroring quantum or relational information models.

## Core Concepts
- **Entangled Geoids**: Two or more geoids that deform or resonate simultaneously, regardless of rotation sequence.
- **Field-Bound Axis Clusters**: Groups of axes that activate as interdependent units due to shared contradiction history.
- **Scar Lattice**: A network of scars that influence each other’s memory decay, echo, or collapse behavior.
- **Echo Collapse Relay**: A chain reaction in which collapse in one geoid triggers predictable destabilization in others.

## Architecture
- Tracks long-term co-activation histories between geoids, axes, and layers.
- Defines resonance mirrors and axis linkages based on scar correlation density.
- Allows prediction of cross-geoid echo propagation and collapse harmonics.

## Parameters
- EntanglementThreshold: minimum co-activation required for entanglement
- AxisLinkDecay: how long axis pairs stay entangled without reinforcement
- ScarClusterFriction: resistance to dissociation in scar-linked networks
- RelayHopLimit: how many geoids collapse relays can affect downstream

## Algorithms / Functions
- `detect_geoid_entanglement(a, b)`
- `reinforce_axis_cluster(coincident_use)`
- `propagate_echo_collapse(entangled_nodes)`
- `update_scar_lattice_network(pulse_cycle)`

## Interactions
- Mirrors drift, scar saturation, and echo patterns from OPS modules
- Enables prediction of field-wide semantic distortion from a single contradiction
- Future use: memory crystallization, non-linear rotation behavior, distributed translation

## Examples
- L2 scar in Geoid A correlates with L2 scar in Geoid B across 14 pulses → entanglement declared
- Collapse in symbolic geoid triggers deformation in 3 mythic-aligned geoids downstream

## Open Questions
- Can entangled scars form permanent semantic identity networks?
- Should echo relays be controllable or allowed to self-propagate?
- Is there a threshold where entangled clusters generate autonomous knowledge formations?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Entanglement principles and propagation logic defined; long-term semantic correlations introduced
