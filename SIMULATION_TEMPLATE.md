## Rotation Analysis

| Axis         | Primary Layer Hit | Outcome     | Scar | Collapse |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|------|----------|
| [Axis Name]  | [Layer]           | [Result]    | Yes/No | Yes/No  |
| ...          | ...               | ...         | ...  | ...      |

## Scar Log

- [Layer] → Scar from [axis or condition]
- [Optional echo drift direction or scar type]

---

## Mirror Vault Observations

- [Pulse count or detection event]
- [Axis overuse or drift detected]
- [Rebalancing or entropy injection, if any]

---

## Expected Echo Behavior

- [Which layer is expected to receive echo]
- [Is there fractal or recursive feedback?]

---
