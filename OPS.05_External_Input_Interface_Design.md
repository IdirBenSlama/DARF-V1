# OPS.05 – External Input Interface Design
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To define how Kimera receives input from external environments—text, data, media, signals—and formats it into contradiction-compatible geoid forms. This module serves as the ingestion boundary between Kimera and the world.

## Core Concepts
- **Input Packet**: A bundled segment of incoming data with metadata and tension metadata.
- **Semantic Preprocessor**: Module that normalizes input and estimates initial pressure profile.
- **Geoid Constructor**: Converts meaningful contradiction-bearing patterns into rotatable semantic fields.
- **Modality Router**: Determines the processing path based on input type and semantic density.

## Architecture
- Input is scanned, segmented, normalized, and framed for semantic rotation.
- Contradiction seeds are extracted and tension vectors initialized.
- Each valid input packet spawns a geoid with preloaded layer resonance estimation.

## Parameters
- AcceptedModalities: e.g., [text, symbol, image-tag, gesture-code, data-stream]
- MaxInputLength: upper bound of raw signal length before fragmentation
- PreprocessingStrategy: logic, poetic, statistical, raw-symbolic, etc.
- InputScarSensitivity: probability that input may inherit existing scar types

## Algorithms / Functions
- `preprocess_input(input_data)`
- `detect_contradiction_seed(data_stream)`
- `construct_geoid_from_input(packet)`
- `route_input_by_modality(signature)`

## Interactions
- Feeds classified contradiction into Contradiction Mapping Engine
- Collaborates with Axis Detection and Surface Interface for polyglot integration
- Can receive signals from external environments (users, sensors, crawlers, datasets)

## Examples
- JSON data stream with conflicting time ranges → contradiction detected → structural layer activated
- Poetic sentence in Farsi → high resonance with Symbolic and Mythic layers → routed for axis rotation

## Open Questions
- How should ambiguity or multi-layer contradictions be pre-processed?
- Can input include recursive signals (self-referential contradictions)?
- Should raw numeric and symbolic channels be routed to separate subsystems?

## Changelog
- v1.0: External interface formalized; input pre-processing and geoid construction pipeline defined
