# FWD.03 – Chaos Propagation & Void Mapping
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To define the conditions and dynamics under which semantic chaos propagates across the Kimera field, and to map voids—regions where contradiction fails to deform meaning, collapses silently, or cannot resonate.

## Core Concepts
- **Chaos Zone**: A region in the semantic field where contradiction outcomes become unpredictable or cascade uncontrollably.
- **Void Node**: A geoid or layer segment that absorbs contradiction without transformation, resonance, or scar.
- **Fractal Collapse**: A recursive collapse that branches unpredictably across multiple axes or layers.
- **Null Signature**: A contradiction profile that fails to activate any known axis or layer response.

## Architecture
- Kimera tracks chaotic behavior using entropy gradient vectors.
- Voids are recorded when multiple contradiction types pass through without resistance or memory.
- Chaos is not treated as failure but as signal of an unmodeled or higher-dimensional epistemic structure.

## Parameters
- EntropyThreshold: minimum required disorder to classify a region as chaotic
- VoidPersistenceRate: how long a void remains unmapped or unresponsive
- CollapseDepthLimit: recursion depth before chaotic chain is halted
- ChaosAmplificationRate: sensitivity of the field to cascade echo

## Algorithms / Functions
- `detect_chaos_from_collapse_patterns()`
- `scan_for_void_nodes(geoid_matrix)`
- `propagate_fractal_collapse_event(source)`
- `register_null_signature(input_data)`

## Interactions
- Works with Mirror Vault and Scar Memory to detect unrecoverable feedback loops
- Informs Axis Routing to avoid void regions unless explicitly triggered
- Triggers entropy injection or regeneration cascade when chaos spreads

## Examples
- Input contradiction rotates through all enabled axes → no deformation or scar → null signature → void logged
- Cultural-symbolic contradiction triggers cascade collapse across 5 geoids → chaos zone detected → entropy wall deployed

## Open Questions
- Can chaos be harnessed as a generative event?
- What does a geoid composed only of void scars behave like?
- Is it possible to rotate a contradiction out of a chaos zone without external input?
