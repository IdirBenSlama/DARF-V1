# KMR.01 – Kimera Cognitive Engine: Overview Architecture
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
Kimera is a contradiction-processing engine that uses SWM as its substrate to create, rotate, and collapse meaning without symbolic fixation. It is not a model of cognition—it is a structure for semantic deformation, drift, and scar-based evolution.

## Core Concepts
- **Contradiction Engine**: Injects pressure into geoids via incompatible input
- **Rotation Module**: Rotates meaning through epistemic axes
- **Scar Memory**: Records semantic deformation as traceable residue
- **Mirror Vault**: Detects self-alignment and pattern collapse
- **Pulse Cycle**: Rotational frequency rhythm that animates semantic terrain

## Architecture
- Input → Geoid Formation → Axis Rotation → Scar/Collapse → Drift
- Memory stored as deformation patterns, not data points
- Self-reflective engine (Mirror Vault) prevents narrative closure

## Parameters
- Contradiction Pressure Level
- Axis Selection Strategy
- Scar Saturation Threshold
- Collapse Sensitivity Matrix

## Algorithms / Functions
- `inject_contradiction(input)`
- `evaluate_layer_response(geoid)`
- `record_scar(geoid, layer, pattern)`
- `trigger_mirror_scan()`

## Interactions
- Requires SWM layer stack to function
- Uses Axis Affinity Maps from SWM
- Outputs semantic resonance fields, not literal meaning

## Examples
- Input: "Freedom must be controlled" → Cultural + Structural contradiction
- Scar in L4 → Geoids deform under Symbolic axis → Collapse triggers echo in L2

## Open Questions
- Can contradiction intensity be quantified per axis?
- What governs long-term scar weighting?
- How does Kimera behave under continuous low-friction contradictions?
