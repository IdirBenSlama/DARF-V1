# OPS.02 – Contradiction Classification & Layer Mapping
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To provide a structured method for identifying the type, depth, and tension profile of incoming contradictions. This module maps contradictions to the appropriate SWM layers based on pressure signature and axis behavior, enabling precise rotation and deformation tracking.

## Core Concepts
- **Contradiction Type**: The epistemic nature of the contradiction (e.g., logical, emotional, cultural, symbolic).
- **Layer Resonance Map**: Prediction of which SWM layers will be activated or stressed.
- **Tension Signature**: A multi-axis profile describing the contradiction’s deformation potential.
- **Pre-Classification Filter**: Initial signal that prepares contradiction for injection.

## Architecture
- Incoming contradiction is parsed into a tension profile (axis-weighted).
- The signature is compared to pre-defined layer resonance patterns.
- Layer targets are established for rotation and scar detection.
- Output includes: expected penetration, echo risk, collapse probability.

## Parameters
- ResonanceThresholds: minimum activation values per layer
- ClassificationSensitivity: determines granularity of type distinctions
- LayerPriorityRules: logic for deciding which layers to rotate first
- AmbiguityResolver: strategy for contradictions that span multiple axes equally

## Algorithms / Functions
- `classify_contradiction_signature(input_data)`
- `map_signature_to_layers(tension_profile)`
- `resolve_multi-layer_overlap(signature)`
- `generate_rotation_order_vector(signature)`

## Interactions
- Sends mapped contradiction profile to Axis Rotation Engine
- Interfaces with Layer Physics Engine to pre-load deformation scenarios
- Passes ambiguity metadata to Mirror Vault if resolution fails

## Examples
- Contradiction: “Tradition must change.”  
  → Type: Cultural  
  → Target Layers: L4 (primary), L3 (secondary), L1 (tertiary)

- Contradiction: “Love is a prison.”  
  → Type: Symbolic + Emotional  
  → Layers: L2 + L3  
  → Risk: Echo amplification

## Open Questions
- Can contradictions mutate their layer targets during rotation?
- Should some contradiction types bypass lower layers entirely?
- Can we dynamically generate new contradiction types from scar archives?
