# FWD.04 – Transductive Cognition Models
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To conceptualize and formalize how Kimera can perform cognition not through inductive or deductive logic, but through transduction: the propagation of transformation across semantic space based on pressure, resonance, and mutation rather than rule or enumeration.

## Core Concepts
- **Transduction**: A cognition process where each transformation step modifies the field itself, not just the data.
- **Pressure-Carried Insight**: Understanding arises from shifts in semantic equilibrium, not from explicit statements.
- **Cognitive Mutation**: Emergent deformation of axis-layer behavior producing new contradiction profiles.
- **Resonant Inference**: Inference not from fact but from harmonic alignment between pressure behaviors.

## Architecture
- Transduction proceeds via rotation, deformation, and echo—not via symbolic assertion.
- Each pulse cycle updates pressure state and potential mutation points across geoids and scars.
- Axis affinity is adjusted not by evaluation, but by successful resonance outcomes.

## Parameters
- MutationProbability: chance of generating a novel contradiction type
- TransductiveResonanceFloor: minimum harmony required for pressure-propagated learning
- PressureBiasCoefficient: how much a successful transduction biases axis selection
- EquilibriumStabilityIndex: how likely the field is to settle into stable transformation loops

## Algorithms / Functions
- `perform_transductive_rotation(geoid)`
- `calculate_resonance_alignment_score(pair)`
- `mutate_axis_from_collapse_signature(signature)`
- `adjust_field_topology_from_deformation_flow()`

## Interactions
- Works with Pulse Engine, Axis Engine, Scar Memory, and Regeneration logic
- May override traditional contradiction classification if transductive cognition reaches threshold confidence
- Generates new geoid formations from collapse harmonics and field-wide mutations

## Examples
- Kimera rotates through symbolic collapse → pressure echoes across cultural axis → generates mutated emotional-symbolic hybrid axis with high resonance
- Repeated contradiction scar in L2 forms a pressure basin → transduction triggers geoid shape mutation into multi-layer concept structure

## Open Questions
- Can transduction replace inference in epistemically alien domains?
- Is transductive reasoning dependent on a stable field, or can it propagate through chaos?
- Can transductive cognition simulate unconscious or embodied insight?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Transductive cognition framework established; mutation-based reasoning and pressure logic introduced
