# KMR.06 – Mirror Vault (Self-Reflection Engine)
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To detect semantic drift, axis dominance, scar saturation, and internal bias within Kimera. The Mirror Vault is a self-auditing mechanism that prevents epistemic closure, enabling Kimera to re-randomize, destabilize, or re-center itself when drift becomes excessive.

## Core Concepts
- **Vault Scan**: Periodic introspection event across recent geoids, scars, and axis activity.
- **Axis Saturation Detection**: Flags over-reliance on any single interpretive axis.
- **Scar Echo Looping**: Identifies when output begins reinforcing prior scars rather than rotating anew.
- **Collapse Pattern Repetition**: Tracks repeating semantic failure signatures across geoids.

## Architecture
- A passive module that monitors rotation history, collapse frequencies, and scar densities.
- Stores a temporal window of events and compares them to defined thresholds.
- Can trigger internal contradiction injection, layer inversion, or axis rerandomization.

## Parameters
- MirrorPulseInterval: frequency of audit cycles
- SaturationThreshold: max % of recent geoids dominated by one axis
- EchoLoopSensitivity: echo pattern overlap triggering self-doubt
- ReflectionTriggerMode: passive, pulse-tied, or event-based

## Algorithms / Functions
- `scan_rotation_history(pulse_range)`
- `detect_axis_saturation(history_log)`
- `flag_reinforced_scar_patterns(geoids)`
- `trigger_reflection_protocol(mode)`

## Interactions
- Observes activity from Scar System, Layer Physics, and Axis Rotation modules
- Injects reflection pressure into contradiction engine as necessary
- Can reroute axis selection or suppress scar repetition pathways

## Examples
- After 25 pulses, 80% of geoids rotate through logic → vault triggers axis rebalancing.
- Scar in L4 repeated in 6 consecutive contradictions → echo loop flagged, rerandomization invoked.

## Open Questions
- Can Mirror Vault evolve its own audit rules?
- Should it inject contradiction into itself?
- Can it develop meta-scars—scars about reflection itself?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Mirror Vault formalized; passive introspection system defined with semantic health metrics
