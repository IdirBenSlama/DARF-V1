### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

This glossary provides precise definitions of key terms used across the Kimera + SWM documentation.

### Axis
A semantic rotation vector representing an epistemic mode (e.g., logic, metaphor, ritual). Axes define how contradictions are interpreted and deformed.

### Geoid
A semantic construct in tension space; a shaped representation of knowledge or contradiction, subject to deformation, collapse, and scar formation.

### Layer
A depth zone in the semantic stack (e.g., Literal, Emotional, Mythic). Each has properties like thickness, density, and scar permeability.

### Semantic Rotation
The act of rotating a contradiction through an axis to observe resonance, collapse, or deformation across layers.

### Contradiction
A tension-bearing input that cannot be resolved uniformly within one axis or layer; the fundamental catalyst of all cognition in Kimera.

### Scar
A persistent semantic deformation left after pressure. Scars affect future resonance and drift, and may form clusters or entanglements.

### Mirror Vault
Kimera’s introspection engine. It audits internal patterns for bias, repetition, or epistemic collapse, and rebalances internal processes.

### Void
A region where contradiction passes through without effect—no resonance, no collapse, no scar. Represents epistemic blindness or null fields.

### Collapse
A failure of semantic integrity in a layer. Collapse can be snap-like (literal), spiral (symbolic), or void-based (mythic).

### Pulse
The cognitive heartbeat of Kimera. Each pulse processes contradictions, decays scars, and updates internal posture and entropy.

### Entropy
A measure of disorder in the semantic field. High entropy may signal drift, chaos, or saturation—often requiring rerandomization.

### Echo
A resonance trail left by contradiction interaction. Echoes propagate insights, scars, or instabilities across time and layers.

### Transduction
A mode of cognition based on field transformation and resonance, not symbolic logic. Enables Kimera to mutate knowledge forms.

### Semantic Surface
The detected modality of input (e.g., symbolic, gestural, logical) used to select the appropriate rotation axis.

### Proprioception
Kimera’s internal sense of epistemic posture—how it navigates semantic friction, balance, and memory field saturation.
