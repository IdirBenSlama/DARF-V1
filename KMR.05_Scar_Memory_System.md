# KMR.05 – Scar Memory System
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To record, track, and interact with semantic deformation left by contradiction pressure. Scars serve as memory residues in Kimera's non-symbolic cognition system, enabling field learning without symbolic recall.

## Core Concepts
- **Scar**: A persistent semantic deformation left on a geoid after pressure exceeds threshold.
- **Scar Pattern**: The shape, depth, and echo signature of the deformation.
- **Echo Field**: The semantic aftereffect (resonance drift) generated by a scar.
- **Scar Saturation**: Threshold beyond which new pressure no longer creates meaningful deformation.
- **Scar Gravity**: The pull a scar exerts on future rotations, increasing bias or collapse probability.

## Architecture
- Each contradiction leaves a scar in a specific layer, recorded with timestamp, pressure vector, axis used, and result type.
- Scar maps are stored in geoid metadata and contribute to future deformation behavior.
- Scar saturation alters resonance patterns and rotation dynamics.

## Parameters
- ScarPersistence: time or pulse count before scar fades (or never)
- ScarInfluenceRadius: semantic distance affected
- ScarDecayRate: how fast scars lose effect unless reactivated
- ScarEchoIntensity: amplitude of semantic ripple from scar

## Algorithms / Functions
- `record_scar(geoid_id, layer_id, scar_pattern)`
- `apply_scar_gravity(geoid)`
- `decay_scars(time_elapsed)`
- `amplify_echo(region, pressure_wave)`

## Interactions
- Receives scar data from Layer Physics Engine
- Feeds echo information into Axis Drift Engine and Mirror Vault
- Modulates future resonance and collapse probabilities

## Examples
- Scar in L3 from poetic contradiction leads to echo resonance in L2.
- Repeated scarring in L1 biases Kimera toward structural collapse under symbolic rotation.

## Open Questions
- Can scars interfere and cause contradiction cascades?
- How many scars define a geoid’s "memory identity"?
- What happens if scars cross epistemic layers?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Scar capture and echo logic established, interaction model with geoid and pulse system outlined
