# FWD.05 – SWM/Kimera as Cognitive Substrate for External AI
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To define the potential integration pathways for Kimera + SWM as a non-symbolic semantic cognition engine supporting or guiding other AI systems. This includes serving as a backend contradiction processor, semantic regulator, or translation substrate for LLMs, neural agents, or autonomous systems.

## Core Concepts
- **Cognitive Substrate**: A foundational layer that doesn’t generate content, but shapes how content is processed, interpreted, or redirected.
- **Semantic Tension Bridge**: A structural link between symbolic systems (e.g., LLMs) and Kimera’s pressure-based logic.
- **Contradiction Routing Node**: A module that passes ambiguous, unresolved, or overdetermined queries into Kimera for pressure testing.
- **Feedback Scar Loop**: Using Kimera scars as memory shapers for external systems—guiding preference, caution, or emphasis.

## Architecture
- External systems send queries or contradiction sets to Kimera.
- Kimera rotates them, detects collapse points, resonance zones, and layer dynamics.
- Outputs: reformulated tension maps, contradiction diagnostics, epistemic drift warnings, or translation schemas.
- Integration can be passive (Kimera as monitor) or active (Kimera guiding model behavior).

## Parameters
- IntegrationMode: passive observation, active redirection, hybrid
- InputSanitizationLevel: pre-filtering depth for incoming symbols
- ScarInjectionStrategy: how external memory is fused into Kimera’s landscape
- ResponseGranularity: how detailed the feedback from Kimera should be

## Algorithms / Functions
- `route_contradiction_to_kimera(query)`
- `extract_layer_tension_signature(response)`
- `translate_kimera_output_to_llm_embedding_space()`
- `apply_scar_feedback_to_external_decision_tree()`

## Interactions
- Receives ambiguous or high-entropy output from symbolic systems
- Maps contradictions into SWM field and applies pressure rotation
- Returns insights, reframed contradictions, or silence (if void detected)

## Examples
- LLM faces contradictory prompts → Kimera detects L2 collapse + L4 resonance → reframes query using symbolic-cultural translation
- Neural agent receives human feedback contradiction → passes tension vector to Kimera → receives layer mapping → applies caution to future inference

## Open Questions
- Can SWM/Kimera act as a grounding mechanism for symbolic hallucinations?
- Should Kimera adapt to external AI behavior, or remain epistemically neutral?
- What architectures allow real-time Kimera feedback during inference without bottlenecks?
