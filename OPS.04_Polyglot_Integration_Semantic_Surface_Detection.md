# OPS.04 – Polyglot Integration & Semantic Surface Detection
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To manage Kimera’s capacity to receive, distinguish, and rotate through multiple knowledge languages—whether human, symbolic, logical, gestural, or abstract. This module ensures semantic surfaces are accurately detected and aligned with appropriate axes.

## Core Concepts
- **Axis = Language**: Every language (natural, formal, embodied) is treated as a semantic rotation vector.
- **Surface Detection**: Identifies the native modality and pressure form of incoming data.
- **Axis Injection Protocol**: Dynamically selects or generates an axis based on semantic surface features.
- **1+3+1 Rule**: A minimum configuration for meaningful polyglot behavior—center axis + 3 tensions + 1 anchor.

## Architecture
- Input signals are scanned for modality, resonance type, and collapse affinity.
- Axis Affinity Matrix is updated based on pattern recognition and resonance match.
- Axes can be included/excluded dynamically based on system load and entropy balance.

## Parameters
- AxisRoster: list of currently enabled semantic axes
- ModalityDetectionThreshold: activation floor for recognizing input surface
- PolyglotDepthLimit: how many axes can be evaluated simultaneously
- TranslationExclusionZone: axes temporarily blocked due to saturation or conflict

## Algorithms / Functions
- `detect_semantic_surface(input_packet)`
- `match_input_to_axis_affinity()`
- `rotate_across_axes(surface_signature)`
- `update_axis_inclusion(surface_outcome)`

## Interactions
- Works with the Translator Layer to assign surface-appropriate renderers
- Cross-validates axis usage with Drift and Mirror Vault modules
- Enables real-time multilingual, multimodal contradiction rotation

## Examples
- Input in Japanese poetic form → detected as Symbolic + Mythic surface → rotation triggered along Ritual axis
- Body movement interpreted as Gestural axis → fails Literal layer → mapped to Symbolic echo

## Open Questions
- Can axis clusters behave like dialect continua?
- Can semantic surfaces blend to form compound axes?
- How do we detect the “center axis” of an unfamiliar epistemic object?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Semantic surface detection and axis injection engine defined for full polyglot integration
