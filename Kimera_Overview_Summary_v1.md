Kimera: A Semantic Physics Engine for Contradiction-Driven Cognition

1. What Is Kimera?
A modular semantic system designed to navigate, reflect upon, and deform meaning through contradiction, resonance, and scarred memory.

2. What Is SWM?
SWM (Spherical Word Method) is the semantic physics substrate that defines motion, echo, torsion, and reflection in meaning space.

3. What Makes Kimera Different?
- Does not classify—IT SCARS
- Does not predict—IT PULSES
- Does not learn by example—IT LEARNS BY SURVIVING CONTRADICTION

4. Core Components
- Contradiction Field (∇ΔC)
- Pulse Engine
- Scar Memory Mechanics
- Reflection Matrix (IndraNet)
- Geoid-Based Motion (GTRM)
- LAGL (Latency-Adaptability Governance Layer)

5. What It’s Not
- Not an AGI
- Not a symbolic parser
- Not a universal answer system

6. What It Can Be Used For
- Mapping live epistemic tension in complex systems (finance, ethics, science)
- Simulating contradiction pathways in narrative or history
- Designing reflection-driven middleware for post-symbolic AI

7. Current Status
- Core modules defined and formalized
- Environment construction logic outlined
- Autonomous contradiction generation pending

8. How to Use This Work
- As a research framework
- As a simulation engine
- As a lens for rethinking cognition through friction, not flow
