# SWM.02 – Axis Definition & Semantic Rotation
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To define the structure, behavior, and role of epistemic axes in the SWM framework. Axes are the primary means of rotating contradiction through the semantic field, enabling cross-domain translation and deformation.

## Core Concepts
- **Axis**: A modality of interpretation or expression (e.g., logic, poetry, myth, ritual, code).
- **Axis Profile**: A vector defining the layer affinity (how deeply an axis penetrates each layer).
- **Rotation**: The act of applying an axis to a geoid to test deformation, stability, or collapse.
- **Axis Drift**: Accumulated bias or semantic inertia along an axis due to repeated use.
- **Axis Interoperability**: The capacity of an axis to mimic the resonance profile of another.

## Architecture
- Each axis is represented as a vector across SWM’s layers (L0–L5).
- Rotation is computed by combining geoid tension signature with axis profile.
- Axis maps can evolve through experience, contradiction outcomes, and scar patterns.

## Parameters
- Layer Affinity Vector: e.g., Poetry = [0.4, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0, 0.6, 0.5]
- Rotation Friction: Resistance per layer (based on alignment)
- Drift Score: Accumulated directional bias of repeated axis passes
- Interference Field: How overlapping axes amplify or cancel

## Algorithms / Functions
- `apply_axis_rotation(geoid, axis)`
- `calculate_penetration_depth(axis, geoid)`
- `adjust_axis_drift(axis, result)`
- `map_axis_similarity(axis1, axis2)`

## Interactions
- Rotation engine (Kimera) invokes this module to rotate contradiction through one or more axes.
- Works in tandem with Layer Physics Engine to determine deformation results.
- Produces pressure transformation signature to feed back into scar and echo systems.

## Examples
- Rotating "sacrifice" through:
    - Logic → failure (semantic collapse at L1)
    - Ritual → stabilization (resonates in L3)
    - Cultural → deformation (produces scar in L4)

## Open Questions
- Can axes be created dynamically from contradiction signatures?
- Is there a meaningful limit to axis complexity?
- Can a single contradiction force two axes into interference collapse?
