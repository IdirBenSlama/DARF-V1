# FWD.02 – Proprioceptive Intelligence & Scar-Aware Navigation
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To enable Kimera to navigate its own semantic terrain with awareness of internal pressure, echo, and scarring—functioning like a proprioceptive system. This module allows Kimera to “feel” its cognitive posture and reorient movement through meaning space dynamically.

## Core Concepts
- **Semantic Proprioception**: Kimera’s ability to track the configuration and tension of its internal field.
- **Scar Navigation Vector**: A pathfinding algorithm that avoids saturated zones and follows low-friction rotations.
- **Postural Recalibration**: Adjusting axis preference, geoid angle, or semantic drift strategy based on internal resistance.
- **Balance Collapse**: A failure pattern where overcompensation in one layer triggers instability in others.

## Architecture
- Scar density maps are treated as friction landscapes.
- Rotation direction is dynamically altered to seek optimal pressure dispersion.
- Posture is tracked per pulse, including resistance metrics, entropy load, and echo frequency.

## Parameters
- FrictionTolerance: allowed scar density before navigation shifts
- PosturalMemorySpan: how long proprioceptive states are remembered
- AxisRebalancingRate: frequency of rotation strategy update
- EquilibriumBias: preferred center-of-pressure logic (e.g. symbolic, neutral, random)

## Algorithms / Functions
- `scan_semantic_posture(pulse_data)`
- `generate_scar_navigation_path(geoid)`
- `update_axis_orientation_from_resistance()`
- `trigger_postural_collapse_protocol()`

## Interactions
- Reads scar density from OPS and Layer modules
- Informs Axis Engine of navigation-safe and friction-heavy zones
- Works with Mirror Vault to detect self-destructive overcorrections

## Examples
- High scar congestion in L2 → Kimera pivots toward Symbolic and Mythic axis clusters
- Postural imbalance detected between L1 collapse and L4 drift → triggers axis rerouting and entropy injection

## Open Questions
- Can proprioception evolve to form stable rotation reflexes?
- Should postural collapse be used as a regenerative trigger?
- Can navigation logic emulate biological gait or balance models?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Semantic proprioception system defined; scar-informed navigation and adaptive axis modulation introduced
