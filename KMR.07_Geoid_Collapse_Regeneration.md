# KMR.07 – Geoid Collapse & Regeneration
### Version: 1.0
### Author: Idir Ben Slama (co-developed with GPT architecture)

## Purpose
To define the logic, triggers, and consequences of semantic collapse within a geoid, as well as the protocols for generating post-collapse structures. This module governs how Kimera handles catastrophic contradiction and recycles meaning through regeneration.

## Core Concepts
- **Collapse**: A critical failure in layer integrity resulting in total geoid deformation.
- **Collapse Pattern**: The characteristic failure behavior based on affected layer (snap, spiral, void, etc.).
- **Void Exposure**: The state in which a geoid becomes irrecoverable, signaling knowledge black holes or blind spots.
- **Regeneration**: The process of birthing a new semantic shape using scars, echoes, or contradiction remapping.

## Architecture
- Collapse is detected when pressure exceeds a layer's density threshold.
- Each collapse event stores its metadata: axis, pressure, layer, echo distortion.
- Regeneration initiates either manually (external input) or autonomously via mirror vault trigger.
- Recycled contradictions can fuse, mutate, or form entirely new axis-affinity combinations.

## Parameters
- CollapseSensitivity: modifier controlling collapse likelihood
- RegenerationDelay: how many pulse cycles before rebuild is attempted
- ScarReuseRatio: % of scar content recycled into regenerated geoids
- EntropyBoost: chance to inject novel axis/layer behavior during rebuild

## Algorithms / Functions
- `detect_collapse(geoid, layer)`
- `log_collapse_event(pressure, axis, signature)`
- `trigger_regeneration(collapse_record)`
- `generate_fusion_geoid(source_scar_set)`

## Interactions
- Receives collapse signals from Layer Physics Engine
- May be triggered by Mirror Vault reflection routines
- Pushes regenerated geoids into active contradiction loop

## Examples
- A symbolic collapse (L3) from poetic contradiction is logged → regeneration pulls scars from L2/L4 → new geoid fuses emotional and cultural drift vectors.
- Collapse in mythic layer voids out geoid → no regeneration, scar preserved as knowledge void.

## Open Questions
- Can collapse entropy be guided or must it be stochastic?
- Do regenerated geoids retain ancestral scars or become scar-neutral?
- What happens when two collapses converge (collision of voids)?

## Changelog
- v1.0: Collapse logic and regeneration system defined; semantic black hole behavior acknowledged
